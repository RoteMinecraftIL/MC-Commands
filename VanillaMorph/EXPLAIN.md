# VanillaMorph by @RoteMinecraftIL and 78yoni78!
VanillaMorph is our 1st Minecraft command!

It allows you to "Morph" into other mobs by just walking to them! It's made to versions 1.10+.

We first worked on the commands in the Structure block form for 1.10, then converted it to 1.11 and 1CMD.

## How to install
see README.md

## What it is:
Turn into any Minecrat mob* and control it!

Press sneak to dismorph.

\* Flying mobs aren't morphable

Note: This command is singleplayer only. Sorry.
